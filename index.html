					<h3>Which Came First? The Poverty or The Malaise?</h3>
					<p> In our efforts as data scientists it's important to not just explore the relationships between certain metrics of social or societal well-being,
						it's equally important to investigate the causes of the circumstances we measure. Americans who are better compensated for their labor have more free time to exercise, and have
						more money to put towards their overall wellness budget. Nutritionists, physical trainers, gym memberships, the list goes on and on. Americans with less favorable compensation
						have less time to exercise, and, due to smaller budgets and often less access to nutritious food, less healthy diets.
